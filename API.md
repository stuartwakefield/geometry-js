Returns the position of the point along the **y** axis.

### point.distance(other)

Returns the distance between the point and **other**.

### point.direction(other)

Returns the angle (in radians) of the point **other**, the angle is counterclockwise
in relation to the azimuth, the azimuth is the positive x axis.

**x** and **y**. Both **x** and **y** must be numbers.

### point.substract(other)

Returns a new **Point** that represents the position of the point after subtracting the
coordinates of the point **other**, which must be an instance of **Point**.

## Class: geometry.Line(start, end)

**Line** is created using the methods `geometry.createLine(start, end)` and
`geometry.createLineRaw(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.

### line.start()

Returns the **Point** representing the start of the line.

### line.end()

### line.direction()

Returns the angle (in radians) of the line counterclockwise in relation to the
azimuth.

### line.intersect(other)

Returns the **Point** at which **other** intersects this **Line** instance. Will
return **null** if the lines do not intersect.

### line.containsPoint(point)

Returns **true** if the point sits along the line, **false** otherwise.

### line.contains(other)

Returns **true** if the line **other** is contained within this **Line** instance.

### line.equals(other)

Returns **true** if the line and **other** represent lines starting and ending at
the same points.

### line.reverse()

Returns a new **Line** instance where the **start** and **end** points are reversed.

### line.point(dist)

Returns a **Point** along the line that is the given distance **dist** from the
**start** point. Will return **null** if **dist** is out of bounds.

### line.split(dist)

Returns an array of one or two **Line** instances that represent the two line
components that are produced as a result of splitting the line at the given distance
from start. Returns a single line component if **dist** is out of bounds.

## Class: geometry.Polygon(p1, p2, ..., pN)

**Polygon** is created using the methods `geometry.createPolygon(p1, p2, ...,p3)`
and `geometry.createPolygonRaw(x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xN, yN)`.

### polygon.points()

Returns the points that represent the vertices of the polygon.

### polygon.lines()

Returns the lines that represent the edges of the polygon.

### polygon.perimeter()

Returns the perimeter length of the polygon.

### polygon.area()

Returns the area of the polygon.

### polygon.containsPoint(point)

Returns true if the passed **Point**, point, is contained within the polygon.

### polygon.contains(other)

Returns true if the passed **Polygon**, other, is contained completely within the
polygon.

### polygon.intersectLine(line)

Returns a list of zero to many lines that represent the areas of the passed line
that intersect with the polygon. Line must be an instance of **Line**.

### polygon.intersect(other)

Returns a list of zero to many polygons that represent overlaps between the
polygon and other, which must be an instance of **Polygon**. The list will be
empty if there are no overlaps.

### polygon.union(other)

Returns a polygon that represent the area of the polygon plus the area of other,
which must be an instance of **Polygon**.

### polygon.complement(other)

Returns a list of zero to many polygons that represent the remaining area of
polygon after subtracting the area of other. Other must be an instance of **Polygon**.
The list will be empty if the two polygons are equal.

### polygon.diff(other)

Returns a list of zero to many polygons that represent the differences between
the polygon and **other**. The list will be empty if the two polygons are equal.
The result is equal to the complement of union and intersect. Other must be a
**Polygon**.

###Â polygon.reverse()

Reverses the directions of the points and edges that represent the polygon. Does
not affect the coordinates of the polygon.

### polygon.truncate(dist)

Returns a new **Polygon** that is the result of truncating the perimeter of the
polygon from the first point, a passed **dist**, which must be a number.

### polygon.point(dist)

### float.equal(a, b)

Returns **true** if the two numbers **a** and **b** could represent the same number
taking into consideration floating point accuracy errors.
